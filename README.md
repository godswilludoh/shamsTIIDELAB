# shamsTIIDELAB
## A JavaScript program that makes use of - for loops  - if-else statements -modulo operator (%) to do the following:
##   1. print all the numbers from 1 to 200 with two exceptions. 
### For numbers divisible by 6, prints "Shams" instead of the number, 
### For numbers divisible by 8 (and not 6), prints "TIIDELAB" instead of the number. 
### Prints "ShamsTIIDELAB" for numbers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 (and still print "Shams" or "TIIDELAB" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
